This is an improved version of the previous 3-server architecture, but now we add:

3 Firewalls

SSL Certificate (HTTPS)

3 Monitoring Clients

New Elements and Why We Add Them
Firewalls (3)

Placed in front of each server (Load Balancer, Web Server, Database).

Protects from unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, and malicious traffic.

SSL Certificate

Allows serving traffic over HTTPS (encrypted connection).

Ensures privacy, integrity, and security between user and website.

Monitoring Clients (e.g., SumoLogic, Datadog, New Relic)

Installed on each server to collect metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, HTTP requests, errors).

Sends data to a central monitoring system for alerting and performance analysis.

Key Explanations
Why Firewalls?
They filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocking unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic.

Why HTTPS?
It encrypts data between the user and the server, protecting sensitive information (e.g., login credentials).

What is Monitoring Used For?
It helps track server health, detect failures, optimize performance, and respond to anomalies.

How Does Monitoring Collect Data?
Monitoring agents run on each server and send logs and metrics to a central platform (e.g., SumoLogic, ELK, Prometheus).

Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second)
Configure your monitoring tool to collect metrics from Nginx (via status module or API). Track and alert when QPS exceeds thresholds.

Issues in This Infrastructure
SSL Termination at Load Balancer

Traffic between load balancer and backend servers is unencrypted (possible internal snooping risk).

Only One MySQL Server Accepting Writes

Write operations depend on a single server, creating a performance bottleneck and a single point of failure.

Servers Having All Components

Running database, web server, and app server on every node can lead to resource conflicts and complex management.

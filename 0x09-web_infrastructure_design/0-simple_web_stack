Description
This is a simple one-server web infrastructure design that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Infrastructure Components
Server

A physical or virtual machine that hosts all the components needed to run the website.

In this setup, everything runs on one server with the IP address 8.8.8.8.

Domain Name (foobar.com)

A human-readable name that maps to the server's IP address.

www.foobar.com is a DNS A record that points to the IP 8.8.8.8.

Web Server (Nginx)

Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from users.

Serves static content (e.g., images, CSS, JS).

Passes dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server

Runs the website logic and handles dynamic content requests.

Works with the application files (the website code base).

Application Files (Code Base)

Contains all the source code of the website.

Database (MySQL)

Stores and manages data for the website (e.g., users, posts, transactions).

Communication

The userâ€™s computer communicates with the server using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

Issues with This Setup
Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

Downtime for Maintenance

Any server updates or deployments require stopping the services, leading to downtime.

Scalability Limitations

A single server cannot handle very high traffic efficiently.
